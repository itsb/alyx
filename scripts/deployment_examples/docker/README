alyx docker container
=====================

for use in testing - 

requirements:

  - docker
  - docker-compose
  - an existing database dump in dump.sql.gz

usage:

  $ cp dot-env.example .env
  $ $EDITOR .env
  $ # ... fetch a full alyx dump into dump.sql.gz
  $ docker-compose up -d 

  then login to browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  using 'admin' and the ALYX_DB_PASSWORD used in .env

  the container entrypoint will attempt to reload the database and reconfigure
  the admin user on each invocation based on the presence of certain files:
  
    /alyx/alyx/db_loaded
    /alyx/alyx/superuser_created

  (paths are container-relative; see also alyx-entrypoint.sh)

  to reuse environment (e.g. after 'docker-compose stop alyx'), either
  change entrypoint in compose file, or map an alyx git checkout into '/alyx' 
  as a volume to allow the db_loaded and superuser_created files to persist 
  across runs (commented out example in 'docker-compose.yml')
